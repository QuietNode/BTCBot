Contributing to this Discord bot project is straightforward. Just follow these simple steps:

**Step 1: Install Git**

**Step 2: Create a GitHub Account**
- If you don't have a GitHub account, create one at [https://github.com/](https://github.com/).

**Step 3: Configure Git**
- After installing Git Bash, you need to configure your Git credentials. This helps in identifying the author of the commits you make.
- Open Git Bash and enter the following commands:
`git config --global user.name "Your Name"`
`git config --global user.email "YourGitHubEmail@example.com"`

- **Note for Anonymity:** If you prefer to stay anonymous, you can use any name. To keep your email private, use the no-reply email provided by GitHub.
- Go to your GitHub account, click your profile icon in the top right corner, and go to 'Settings'.
- Navigate to 'Emails' and copy your `@users.noreply.github.com` email.
- Use this email in the git config command for `user.email`.


Go to the https://github.com/buttersbtc/BTCBot page and **Fork the repository**. You can achieve this by pressing the Fork button.

- Create your own branch by writing: `git branch yourBranchName`
- Switch to your branch with `git checkout yourBranchName`.
- Stage your changes with `git add fileName` (note: add the files you changed and want to push for review).
